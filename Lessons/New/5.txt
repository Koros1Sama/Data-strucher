CHAPTER 20

Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory

--- Slide 2: Introduction ---
Transaction
Describes local unit of database processing
Transaction processing systems
Systems with large databases and hundreds of concurrent users
Require high availability and fast response time
Slide 20- 2

--- Slide 3: Transactions ---
Transaction: an executing program
Forms logical unit of database processing
Begin and end transaction statements
Specify transaction boundaries
Read-only transaction
Read-write transaction
Slide 20- 3

--- Slide 4: Database Items ---
Database represented as collection of named data items
Size of a data item called its granularity
Data item
Record
Disk block
Attribute value of a record
Transaction processing concepts independent of item granularity
Slide 20- 4

--- Slide 5: DBMS Buffers ---
DBMS will maintain several main memory data buffers in the database cache
When buffers are occupied, a buffer replacement policy is used to choose which buffer will be replaced
Example policy: least recently used
Slide 20- 5

--- Slide 6: Concurrency Control ---
Transactions submitted by various users may execute concurrently
Access and update the same database items
Some form of concurrency control is needed
The lost update problem
Occurs when two transactions that access the same database items have operations interleaved
Results in incorrect value of some database items
Slide 20- 6

--- Slide 7: The Lost Update Problem ---
Slide 20-7
Figure 20.3 Some problems that occur when concurrent execution is uncontrolled (a) The lost update problem

--- Slide 8: The Temporary Update Problem ---
Slide 20-8

--- Slide 9: The Incorrect Summary Problem ---
Slide 20-9

--- Slide 10: The Unrepeatable Read Problem ---
Slide 20- 10

--- Slide 11: The System Log ---
System log keeps track of transaction operations
Sequential, append-only file
Not affected by failure (except disk or catastrophic failure)
Log buffer
Main memory buffer
When full, appended to end of log file on disk
Log file is backed up periodically
Undo and redo operations based on log possible
Slide 20- 11

--- Slide 12: 20.3 Desirable Properties of Transactions ---
ACID properties
Atomicity
Transaction performed in its entirety or not at all
Consistency preservation
Takes database from one consistent state to another
Isolation
Not interfered with by other transactions
Durability or permanency
Changes must persist in the database
Slide 20- 12

--- Slide 13: Desirable Properties of Transactions (cont’d.) ---
Levels of isolation
Level 0 isolation does not overwrite the dirty reads of higher-level transactions
Level 1 isolation has no lost updates
Level 2 isolation has no lost updates and no dirty reads
Level 3 (true) isolation has repeatable reads
In addition to level 2 properties
Snapshot isolation
